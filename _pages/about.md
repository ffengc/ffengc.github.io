**Google-tcmalloc-simulation-implementation**

The tcmalloc is a memory management project open sourced by Google. I implemented the core functions in tcmalloc through learning and simulation, and implemented a high-concurrency memory pool to replace the native malloc memory development method. Its design purpose is to adapt to the characteristics of a single server with multiple CPU cores, and to ensure that the performance of the memory allocator will not drop sharply due to multi-core competition. In order to reduce memory usage, objects of the same memory size are concentrated in spans composed of several adjacent pages.

**Related technologies:** STL, multi-threading, memory management algorithms, lock-free programming
